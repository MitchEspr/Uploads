# Empire of Zealots

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan marks another key event in the lifespan of the American Empire. Thirty-six years after the Fall of Saigon, another US effort to force a faraway Asian country into their sphere of influence shows to be in vain. Afghanistan has become the latest milestone in a series of military interventions in which the US was unable to achieve their objectives. This pattern not only casts doubt on the empire's strategic decision-making, but also on its ability and commitment in terms of winning wars in the more strategic parts of their empire. This is especially relevant in a time when allies increasingly feel the pull of rival powers that assert their own sphere of influence, such as China and Russia.

America is certainly not the first great power to retreat from Afghanistan after failing to maintain stable rule. The Central Asian country does not have a reputation as being the *Graveyard of Empires* for no reason. The Soviet Union and the British Empire preceded them, and future great powers will likely follow. On the other hand, the cliché of Afghanistan being a kind of kryptonite for empires is not entirely accurate. Many empires ruled Afghanistan in a classic fashion for many years. The various Persian dynasties and Central Asian steppe empires such as the Mongols and Seljuks serve as examples. But the goals of these imperial successes can hardly be compared to those of the United States. As the American Empire is wont to do, it aimed to create a new Afghanistan from the ground up, fully equipped with liberal democratic institutions, aligned with the norms and customs of the *liberal international order* (as the empire likes to brand itself). The aims of the steppe lords of yore were more limited in nature. These empires were satisfied with keeping local rulers in place. As long as they paid tribute for the privilege of being under the nominal rule and protection of the Great Khan, they were satisfied. Given that this arrangement was respected, the empire retained its nominal control. In a way, these khans, kings, and emperors ruled over their subjects like a mafia boss rules over their protection rackets.  This form of governance was common in history, and can be characterized as a *tributary empire*.  Much blame can be laid at the feet of Washington, but the huge costs that the American taxpayer incurred in the decades-long adventure in Afghanistan does not suggest that America was in it for the profit and nominal rule.

The same case in point also means that the empire can neither be compared to the more modern form of a *commercial empire*. The clearest examples of commercial empires are the former colonial empires of Europe, especially in their early days. If looked at in larger context, this becomes even more clear. As Peter Zeihan [repeatedly](https://medium.com/@PeterZeihan/this-is-how-the-world-ends-part-i-2e66263f09cb) lays out in his writings, even the commercial aspects of the American-led post-war institutions weren't built to enrich the Americans at the expense of their sphere of influence. Despite all its efforts to build a global community based on free trade and open shipping lanes, [few countries make less use of it than the United States](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS?end=2019&locations=US-1W-NG-BR-GB-CN-JP-IN-DE-FR-IR&most_recent_value_desc=false&start=2019&view=bar). At the same time, no other country foots the bill for the guaranteeing those open than the United States either. As regular political order requires a Hobbesian Leviathan, so does the *liberal international order*, and that Leviathan is the United States Navy. 

Not only did the United States refrain from building their own commercial empire from their World War II victory, but they actually turned their force against the commercial empires of the time. One of the first post-war actions of the United States was their involvement in ending the hostilities in the Indonesian National Revolution. The conflict would kickstart a series of decolonization conflicts where a commercial empire (in this case that of the Dutch) would face of a native nationalist revolt fighting in search of sovereignty. In this particular case, Washington pressured the Dutch government into relinquishing their possessions in the East Indies, putting an end to over three centuries of Dutch presence in Southeast Asia. Again, this was not done in order to let Americans take charge of the commercial enterprises themselves. In the final peace agreement, it was even agreed that the interests of the Dutch commercial presence in Indonesia would remain respected. In fact, the Americans even used their development aid (the Marshall plan and NATO funding) to entice the Dutch into accepting the new geopolitical reality. 

America drove the point of this new reality home even more during the Suez crisis in 1956. The joint venture of the lingering British and French Empire was humiliated when Eisenhower put an end to its efforts to stop the Egyptian nationalization of the Suez canal. The age of European colonial empires was over, but luckily for them, the American guarantee of global free markets granted their cousins most of the perks they got out of the old imperial systems anyway. For them, safeguarding economic resources was always imperative. As for the Americans, it seems something else than commercial interests are driving their ambitions abroad.

This again begs the question: if not commercial, or tributary interests, what is the driving force behind America's imperial nature? Part of the answer surely lies in the area of national security. Robert Kaplan is instructive in this area:

> "Imperialism is but a form of isolationism, in which the demand for absolute, undefiled security at home leads one to conquer the world, and in the process to become subject to all the world’s anxieties."

During the world wars, the United States were attacked twice by a rising power in Eurasia that was aiming to become a continent-spanning empire in its own right. When the Soviet Union came out of World War II as the de facto ruler of an empire spanning from central Germany to Vladivostok, America experienced a feeling of déjà vu. Afraid that an expansionary federal communist republic that could truly encompass almost all of Eurasia would threaten their national security, America tried to do everything in their power to stop this from happening. Certainly, proxy wars, limited interventions, and supporting military coups and local warlords were often-used plays from their playbook. But it was mostly by enticing regimes with the material economic benefits of being part of the liberal international order that America successfully aligned much of the world to their side of the aisle. In order to allay the fear of the American political establishment of a foreign attack, the rest of the world could choose between either joining the empire on appealing terms or suffering the wrath of the US state apparatus.

But while this explanation goes a long way to explain the American strategy during the Cold War, is it also sufficient to explain the US' continued global presence decades after the Soviet Union's demise? In some ways, the empire's seems to have even expanded rather than retreated. Sure, the country suffered a severe terrorist attack on its home soil. But do attacks carried out by terrorist operators on tourism visas fully explain expanded ambitions in the area of swallowing the world up in liberal market economies, human rights NGOs, and parliamentary democracies? Even during the Cold War, the focus on the latter efforts can hardly be sufficiently explained by the national security argument. Whilst the British Empire in the past used to be satisfied with a divide and conquer strategy, America wasn't really satisfied until countries fully aligned their institutions with those of the liberal international order.

The evolution of the American political elite in the past ten years might reveal something about another driving force behind the US efforts to shape the world. While a certain ideological conviction in favour of a liberal worldview was always part of US decision-making, the transformation of this worldview in just the last decade put the ideological motivations front and centre. In 2008, the flagship of America's progressive political establishment - the Democratic Party - fielded a candidate that was still in opposition to same-sex marriage. A little over a decade and a couple of Supreme Court rulings later, the US State Department provocatively raises Pride flags in its embassies located in Islamic republics. In the same period of time, America's political and cultural establishment went from tippy-toeing around the question of race to wholeheartedly ascribing to a worldview that calls into question the value of the entire western tradition and raises new ethnic hierarchies around guilt and victimhood. In the eyes of its allies in the rest of the western world, the US used to be seen as a moral backwater, a land of guns, religion, and pick-up trucks. After this sudden acceleration of America's revolutionary spirit, the roles have reversed, and it is America that is exporting its values and cultural narratives to the urban centres of its allies. What is being exported is a much more puritanical and progressive liberal worldview than what the rest of the world was used to.

The evolution of the hegemonic worldview among the Ivy League-educated might fire up the moral righteousness of the American regime, but it also means it is playing empire on hard mode. A country like Hungary used to be a reliable member of the transatlantic community, but is increasingly driven into the hands of Russia and China by [denunciations against its domestic affairs](https://hungarytoday.hu/orban-biden-us-hungary-relations-foreign-policy/). Even countries like France increasingly look at America's progressive worldview as something alien and provincial, [characterising its influence as cultural imperialism](https://unherd.com/2020/10/why-is-the-anglo-media-portaying-france-as-the-villain/). The American Empire seems more interested in shaping the world to its own moral and ideological ideas than ruling it in a stable and sustainable fashion. This makes it much more akin to an empire like the Soviet Union, the Carolingian dynasty or the early caliphates. Instead of a tributary empire or a commercial empire, we could characterise the United States as a *missionary empire*.

The emphasis on the more revolutionary ideas of the US elite might give the impression that turned into a missionary empire only very recently. But the entire liberal international order can easily be seen in this same light. Even Robert Kaplan, one of the biggest proponents of American imperialism as a benevolent force in the world, recognised the zealot tendency in its foreign policy, even before the woke revolution:

> "In truth, Iraq in 2003 and 2004 was less a replay of Vietnam than of the Indian Mutiny against the British in 1857 and 1858, when the orientalists and other pragmatists in the British power structure, who wanted to leave traditional India as it was, lost sway to Evangelical and Utilitarian reformers who wanted to modernize and Christianize India—to make it more like England. But such attempts to bring the fruits of Western civilization to the Asian subcontinent were met with a violent revolt against imperial authority." 

At the same time, the American Empire's track record of the past eighty years can hardly be characterized as altogether unsuccessful. It successfully converted the axis powers of World War II to its side. In the following decades, it easily flipped countries like Spain, Portugal, and Greece to its side after the dissolution of their dictatorships. These conversion efforts sometimes required continued military occupation, but mostly it was the result of an appealing proposition that the liberal order entailed. It encompassed a worldview that was on an upward trajectory, and delivered its populations clear improvement in their living conditions. This points out that missionary empires have a clear chance of success as long as their message is attractive and feasible. 

It remains to be seen whether the revolutionary worldview of the modern-day American elites can offer the same appeal. In any case, it is clear that bringing gender equality and LGBT rights to the Islamic world is much more ambitious project than bringing elections and modern banking to Spain was. In fact, the continued popularity of the Trump movement in parts of the United States points out that the American elites and their supporters have not even come to terms with the resistance against their worldview in their own country. The America of guns, religions, and pickup trucks that the Europeans remember from the start of the Afghan war is still present. Some of their most passionate members showed up at the Capitol building on January 6th in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the presidential election results, causing a flashpoint of political unrest. The response of the regime has been to mark *right-wing extremism* as the most prominent threat to the country's domestic security, shifting from the decades-long focus on foreign terrorism. The decision to continue with the planned retreat from Afghanistan despite it initially being a Trump policy may be seen in this light. The missionaries in Washington realise that before they again have the energy and resources to evangelize the world, they first need to evangelize their own. In the mean time, this leaves a void in the world for other players to advance their own pieces in the game of empires called geopolitics. China's Belt & Road Initiative couldn't have been better timed.
